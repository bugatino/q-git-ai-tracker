# Amazon Q → Git AI Tracker

**Amazon Q → Git AI Tracker** is a extension designed to automatically track code insertions generated by Amazon Q and:
-   Creates `git-ai` checkpoints for history tracking
-   Prevents paste events from being flagged as AI
-   **Automated Management**: automatically installs `git-ai` (locally) and adds it to PATH when active.

This helps in maintaining a granular history of AI-generated code changes, making it easier to review and manage AI contributions to your codebase.

## Features

*   **Automatic Detection**: Intelligently detects code insertions that are likely generated by Amazon Q (based on speed, size, and patterns).
*   **Auto Checkpoints**: Automatically triggers a `git-ai` checkpoint when an Amazon Q insertion is detected.
*   **Manual Checkpoint**: Provides a command and status bar item to manually trigger a checkpoint.
*   **Status Bar Integration**: Displays a status bar item for quick access and status monitoring.

## Requirements

This extension relies on the `git-ai` command-line tool to perform the actual checkpoints and will automatically install a bundled version of `git-ai` (v1.0.22) locally within the extension directory. No manual installation is required.
> **Note**: You may need to restart your terminal or VS Code session for `git-ai` to be recognized in your PATH.

## Git AI CLI Reference

This extension manages `git-ai` for you, but you can also use it directly in your terminal.
For full documentation, see [usegitai.com/docs/reference](https://usegitai.com/docs/reference).

### User Commands

#### `git-ai blame <file>`
Enhanced version of `git blame` that shows AI authorship attribution alongside traditional git blame.

#### `git-ai diff [commit]`
Show a git-style unified diff with AI authorship annotations (`🤖toolname` vs `👤username`) for each changed line.

#### `git-ai stats [commit|range]`
Show AI authorship statistics (AI vs Human additions/deletions) for a commit or range of commits.
Use `git-ai stats --json` for machine-readable output.

#### `git-ai show <commit>`
Display the stored AI authorship log for a commit.

#### `git-ai install-hooks`
Automatically configure IDE and agent hooks to send authorship info to `git-ai`. (Handled automatically by this extension).

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

*   `q-git-ai.allow_repositories`: List of glob patterns for repositories where git-ai is allowed. Default: `["**"]` (matches all).
*   `q-git-ai.minChangeSize`: Minimum number of characters changed to be considered as an Amazon Q insertion. (Default: `3`)

## Usage

1.  **Automatic Tracking**: Simply code as usual. When you accept a suggestion from Amazon Q or when Amazon Q inserts code, the extension will detect the change and create a checkpoint.
2.  **Manual Checkpoint**:
    *   Click on the `AI: 0` item in the status bar.
    *   Or run the command `Git AI: Manual Checkpoint (Amazon Q)` from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
