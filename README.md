# Amazon Q → Git AI Tracker

**Amazon Q → Git AI Tracker** is a VS Code extension designed to automatically track code insertions generated by Amazon Q and
-   Creates `git-ai` checkpoints for history tracking
-   Prevents paste events from being flagged as AI
-   **Automated Management**: automatically installs `git-ai` (via curl script) and adds it to PATH when active.

This helps in maintaining a granular history of AI-generated code changes, making it easier to review and manage AI contributions to your codebase.

## Features

*   **Automatic Detection**: Intelligently detects code insertions that are likely generated by Amazon Q (based on speed, size, and patterns).
*   **Auto Checkpoints**: Automatically triggers a `git-ai` checkpoint when an Amazon Q insertion is detected.
*   **Manual Checkpoint**: Provides a command and status bar item to manually trigger a checkpoint.
*   **Status Bar Integration**: Displays a status bar item for quick access and status monitoring.

## Requirements

This extension relies on the `git-ai` command-line tool to perform the actual checkpoints. Ensure that `git-ai` is installed and available in your system's PATH.

### Installing git-ai

To install `git-ai`, please follow the instructions from the [official documentation](https://usegitai.com/docs).

**Mac, Linux, Windows (WSL):**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acunniffe/git-ai/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (non-WSL):**
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acunniffe/git-ai/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Verify the installation by running:
```bash
git-ai --version
```

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

*   `q-git-ai.allow_repositories`: List of glob patterns for repositories where git-ai is allowed. Default: `["**"]` (matches all).
*   `q-git-ai.minChangeSize`: Minimum number of characters changed to be considered as an Amazon Q insertion. (Default: `3`)

## Usage

1.  **Automatic Tracking**: Simply code as usual. When you accept a suggestion from Amazon Q or when Amazon Q inserts code, the extension will detect the change and create a checkpoint.
2.  **Manual Checkpoint**:
    *   Click on the `$(git-commit) AI` item in the status bar.
    *   Or run the command `Git AI: Manual Checkpoint (Amazon Q)` from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).

## Known Issues

*   Ensure `git-ai` is properly configured in your terminal environment.

## How to package extension
1. `npm i -g @vscode/vsce` => `vsce package`
2. install extension `code --install-extension q-git-ai-tracker-0.1.0.vsix`
